Game works on ticks(seconds) for now for every certain amount of ticks. Village
will consist of a max of 20 villagers to start. Each villager can either be a
Miner or a Lumberjack. Miners will gather Rock type resources of up to 3 pieces
per villager, and Lumberjacks will gather up to 3 pieces of wood per villager.
At first you can only gather stone (Miners). You can then with a certain amount
of stone and wood make a house. Your villagers will be defenseless and homeless
to start but they will be well fed and hydrated.

House:
Can house any civilians. Houses start at level 1(State 1). With enough
materials, you can upgrade the house to level 2 and then 3. Once the house is
level 3, you can either keep upgrading it as a house(Will have a benefit in the
future), or make it into a Blacksmith's house, a barracks, a sorcerer's abode,
or a farm.

Farm:
Farms will produce food, per level starting at level 3 and upgradable only as a
farm in the future. It can only house 1 family(This might be 4 to 6 people on
the condition that at least 1 is a farmer!).

Blacksmith House:
Second most expensive. Can only house blacksmiths. If you have enough resources,
you can ask him to make tools or armor for your villagers. If he is un-happy, he
will produce things at 3/4 quantity and 1/2 speed.

Sorcerer's Abode:
Can only house 1 sorcerer! More expensive then any other building. If you have
enough resources, you can ask him to enchant your items for you. If he is
un-happy, he will enchant at 3/4 quantity and 1/2 speed.

Barracks:
It is more expensive to build then a home or farm. Acts like a home but only
soldiers can be there. The longer the soldiers are there the un-happier they
get. It also acts as storage for weapons. It has a level 3 capacity of 8
soldiers.
