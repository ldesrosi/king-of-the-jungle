Overview
-------
This is a project that me and my son started developing to introduce him to test driven development.  The intent is to create a text-based adventure/strategy game where you are in charge of a small village of survivors (not sure yet, as to what they surviving from ).

Here are some of the early story plot that my son is considering :)
1. Set of survival rules left by a man who ruled in the past you've been put here against many other tribes to try to survive
1. You and many other tourists have gotten lost in a jungle and now have to rebuild a community to survive until you can find civilization again.
